The system validates the file format using Python, converts it to CSV, and stores the rates in an AWS DynamoDB database in batch operations, optimizing the process for large-scale data uploads.",
      "description2": "Additionally, the system provides an API to allow other products or services to consume the stored data dynamically, retrieving the specific rate sets based on product type.",
      "description3": "If the process completes successfully, the system sends a notification via AWS SNS topics to relevant stakeholders. In case of errors during validation or processing, error notifications are sent via the same mechanism."
